# mister-barcode-launcher

Run this command to install barcode-launcher on your MiSTer:

```
curl -sSLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felleg/mister-barcode-launcher/refs/heads/main/install_barcode_launcher | sh

# If it is more convenient to you, this shorter command is equivalent:
curl -sSLk https://felx.cc/install-barcode | sh
```
Currently, this requires that your barcode scanner is plugged in before you power on the MiSTer.
